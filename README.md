# Undergraduate Capstone Thesis

Mathematica notebooks, python scripts, and jupyter notebooks written for my physics major undergraduate capstone thesis based on the topic "interplay between neutrino oscillations and linear algebra" done under the supervision of Dr. Sushant Raut at Krea University.

## Description

- We have explored applications of the recently discovered eigenvalue-eigenvector identity in order to streamline and possibly obtain novel symbolic series expansions of neutrino oscillation probabilities. 
- There are also other miscellaneous explorations such as trying to construct a neural network to predict neutrino oscillation parameters given a dataset of neutrino oscillation probabilities

## File sizes of authored mathematica notebooks and wolfram language package files

- Most of the mathematica notebooks and wolfram language package files authored for this research project consist of numerous cells containing taylor series expansions of neutrino oscillation probabilities up to a million terms or more
- As a result, their file sizes exceed 100 mb each and are thus too large to be uploaded to github without tussling with git's lfs (large file storage)
- Because im lazy and i would like to avoid this complexity, i've uploaded all of these files to a [publicly accessible google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LyEbxegiJruPuY5X23IEY6N_fL39nKck?usp=sharing)
- To completely recreate the development environment used in this work, download the google drive folder and save it by its name `series-expansions-of-neutrino-oscillation-probabilties` in the project's root
